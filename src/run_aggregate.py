"""
run_aggregate.py — Module §18.3: run the design grid for a match, parse, store,
and aggregate by median (+ trimmed-mean robustness).

For one match the grid is (per §4/§5/§7/§10):
    for each model:
        for each reasoning level it supports (Gemini: high only):
            for each arm in {primary, conditioning}:
                call forecast() N times (config.N_SAMPLES)

Raw ForecastRecords (incl. unparsed) are appended to JSONL for full provenance
(§21). Parsed+renormalized samples are aggregated into an AggregatedForecast.
Clients are injected, so this is fully testable with offline fakes.
