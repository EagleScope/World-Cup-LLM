config.py — SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for the pre-registered WC-2026 LLM
calibration study.

Every locked parameter from METHODS_PROTOCOL_v1.md lives here and nowhere else.
Nothing in this dict/these constants may be hardcoded elsewhere in the codebase;
modules import from here so the frozen values are auditable in one place.

Section references (§) point at METHODS_PROTOCOL_v1.md.

Provenance of each value:
  FROZEN          — locked by the protocol text; do not change.
  VERIFIED        — checked against the live provider API at build time
                    (model IDs / key validity), then frozen.
  PENDING_SIGNOFF — proposed default that needs the PI's explicit confirmation
                    BEFORE protocol lock (flagged inline; never silently guessed).
